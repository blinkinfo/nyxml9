"""Structured per-inference debug logger for live ML strategy.

Each call to check_signal() writes one JSONL record containing:
  - slot metadata (slug, timestamps)
  - raw data quality indicators (row counts, candle timestamps, buffer length)
  - every feature value with its name
  - NaN breakdown when inference is skipped due to missing features
  - model probability and threshold values
  - fired/skipped decision and side
  - outcome (win/loss) back-filled by log_outcome() after slot resolution

Log format: newline-delimited JSON (JSONL) — one record per line.
Each record is self-contained and can be parsed independently.

Usage:
    from ml import inference_logger

    # On every check_signal() call:
    log_id = inference_logger.log_inference(...)

    # After slot resolves (win/loss known):
    inference_logger.log_outcome(slot_slug, outcome="Up", is_win=True)

Thread safety: all writes are serialised through a threading.Lock so the
file is safe even if multiple threads somehow call the logger concurrently.
The lock is module-level and persists for the lifetime of the process.
